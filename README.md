# CocoaPowder
Breakpoints for Sketch Plugins.

<kbd>![](http://animaapp.s3.amazonaws.com/github/PluginDebugger/PluginDebugger.gif)</kbd>

## Motivation

Instead of following logs the busy console, breakpoints allows you follow your variables on script runtime.

## Integration

1. Drop [CocoaPowder.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnimaApp/CocoaPowder/master/CocoaPowder.js) in your Plugin folder.
2. ```@import 'CocoaPowder.js'``` into your `.cocoascript` files.
3. Run ```cocoapowderSetup();``` once in your script.
4. Add breakpoints with this ```cocoapowderBreakpoint(function (x) { return eval(x); });```

Example:  
```
@import 'CocoaPowder.js'

// Setup
cocoapowderSetup();

function sampleFunction() {
    var myVar = "Before breakpoint";

    // This is how you add a breakpoint
    cocoapowderBreakpoint(function (x) { return eval(x); });

    myVar = "After breakpoint";
    log('Done!');
}

var onRun = function(context) {
    sampleFunction();
}
```

## Deployment
Before deploying your code, make sure you remove breakpoints or call ```disableCocoaPowder();```.
